# My Top Spotify 🎧

This is a mini project that I completed independently to improve my web development skills.

## 📋 Description 

This project is inspired by the design from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16894605-Music-Player-Web-App).

The project provides the ability to play music using a function specific to jQuery. However, there are some features that need improvement:

- **Slide bar**: Adjusting the slide bar affects the audio duration, but the implementation requires refinement.
- **Music playback**: Changing tracks stops the current music but doesn't pause it.
